# Team TJS - Team Java Sucks

> **TJS** stands for **Team Java Sucks**.
> Yes, we write Java. No, we don’t like it. Yes, we mod Minecraft anyway.

## 🧱 About Us

**Team TJS** is a group of Minecraft modders who suffer through Java so you don’t have to.
We make cool, cursed, and occasionally actually useful mods for various versions of Minecraft — from quality-of-life tweaks to full-blown content expansions.

## 🛠 What We Do

- Minecraft mods in Java (Forge, Fabric, or whatever works — aka **nothing**)
- Complain about Java while writing more Java

## Join Us

Love Minecraft modding? Hate Java? You’ll fit right in. Fork a repo, break stuff, and call it a feature (Because thats what Minecraft's code does).
